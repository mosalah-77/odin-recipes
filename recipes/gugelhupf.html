    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A Gugelhupf is a cake traditionally baked in a distinctive ring pan, similar to Bundt cake, but leavened with baker's yeast.</p>
        <p>There are three main types: cocoa; plain with a hint of vanilla and lemon zest; and a marbled combination of the two.</p>
        <p>It is especially popular as a traditional cake in Austria as well as the rest of Central Europe.</p>
