    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Golden and crispy outside, tender and juicy inside—chicken schnitzel is a weeknight favorite for kids and adults alike!</p>
    <p>Most commonly made with pork or veal, this recipe switched to chicken.</p>
    <p>Don’t forget the lemon wedges! 
        Lemon is delightful squeezed onto the finished schnitzel. 
        Traditionally, we would serve the dish with potatoes and tangy cooked red cabbage. 
        You will often find it served with fries. 
        Either way, it is a satisfying, tasty dish that you will want to make again soon.</p>
