    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Nothing says morning comfort quite like good buttermilk pancakes... and these are among the best!</p>
        <p>Super light and super flavorful, these thin pancakes stack up nicely. They have a tart buttermilk flavor with a hint of sweetness.</p>
        <p>They're definitely thinner than a traditional pancake but thicker than a crepe. 
            Serve with some fruit and whipped cream or maple syrup for a morning delight. 
            If you have a griddle, they cook well on that which makes the cooking process a snap.</p>
