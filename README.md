# odin-recipes

In this project, I am building a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to three separate recipe pages.

I have managed to build out 4 separate web pages:
In the Home Page, I have included relative links to the other 3 pages in an unordered list as well as an absolute link, enclosed in a footer tag with text, to attribute the source of the content and images used.
In the other three pages, each one utilizes either relative or absolute image links, or both, to display images, and all three pages have a relative link to direct it to the Home Page. I also utilized h1 and h2 headings, ordered and unordered lists, and paragraph elements to organize and display text content.

On top of getting comfortable working with a CLI instead of a GUI, I also got accustomed to git and its commands as well as commit timing and message conventions.
